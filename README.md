# Graph-Coloring-with-Tabu-Search-Algorithm
This repository is about graph coloring with Tabu Search Algorithm on MATLAB. You can open main.m and run the code. I make the code for general data, dummy data can be generated manually using gen_data.m or you can import real data. 

Graph coloring is a node labeling in graph theory. Graph coloring has many applications in the real world such as scheduling and register allocation. In this project, graph coloring has done using a tabu search algorithm, which is one of the optimization algorithms.
