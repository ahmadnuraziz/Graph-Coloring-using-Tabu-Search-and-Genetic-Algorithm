# Graph Coloring using Tabu Search and Genetic Algorithm
This repository is about graph coloring with Tabu Search and Genetic Algorithm using MATLAB. You can run the code main.m in tabu search folder and ga.m in genetic algorithm folder. I make the code for general data, dummy data can be generated manually using gen_data.m or you can import real data.

Graph coloring is a node labeling in graph theory. Graph coloring has many applications in the real world such as scheduling and register allocation. In this project, graph coloring has done using a tabu search algorithm, which is one of the optimization algorithms.

### Goal
Labeling the nodes with color until there is no color conflict with same edge

### Tools
MATLAB
